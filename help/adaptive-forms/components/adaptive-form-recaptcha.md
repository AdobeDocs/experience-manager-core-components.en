# Adaptive Form reCAPTCHA {#google-recaptcha}

CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a program commonly used in online transactions to distinguish between humans and automated programs or bots. It poses a challenge and evaluates user response to determine if it's a human or a bot interacting with the site. It prevents the user to proceed if the test fails and helps make online transactions secure by keeping bots from posting spam or malicious purposes.

AEM Forms as a Cloud Service supports Google reCAPTCHA v2 in Adaptive Forms. You can use it to present a CAPTCHA challenge on form submission

## Usage {#reasons-to-use-google-recaptcha}


- **Spam and Bot Prevention**: One of the primary reasons to use reCAPTCHA is to prevent spam submissions and malicious bots from flooding your form. reCAPTCHA's advanced algorithms can detect automated attempts to submit the form, thus ensuring that only legitimate users can interact with it.

- **Enhanced Security**: By implementing reCAPTCHA, you add an extra layer of security to your adaptive form. This helps protect sensitive information and prevent malicious users from exploiting vulnerabilities.

- **User Experience**: While CAPTCHAs can sometimes be seen as an inconvenience, reCAPTCHA's adaptive approach means that most users are presented with a streamlined, user-friendly experience that requires minimal interaction. This can help maintain a positive user experience while still deterring bots.

- **Adaptability**: reCAPTCHA's adaptive mechanism analyzes user behavior and interactions to determine whether they are human or not. This means that the level of challenge presented to the user can vary based on the likelihood of them being a bot. This adaptability reduces friction for genuine users while maintaining strong security.

- **Reduced Manual Moderation**: By significantly reducing the number of spam submissions and bot-generated content, reCAPTCHA can save time and resources that would otherwise be spent on manual moderation and clean-up.

### Custom Properties 

![Custom Properties Dialog](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/checkbox-customproperties.png)

Custom properties allow you to associate custom attributes (key-value pairs) to an Adaptive Form core component using the form template. The custom properties are reflected in the properties section of the headless rendition of the component. It allows creating dynamic form behavior that adapts based on the custom attributes values. For example, developers can design various renditions of a Headless Forms component for mobile, desktop, or web platforms, significantly enhancing the user experience across a wide array of devices.
- **Group Name**: You can provide a name to identify the custom property group. You can add, delete, or rearrange multiple custom property groups. After adding the custom property group, you can see the following options:
