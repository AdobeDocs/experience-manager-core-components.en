# Adaptive form switch component{#switch-adaptive-forms-core-component}

The switch component is a graphical user interface used in forms that allows users to select between two options. It is usually a two-state toggle that enables users to choose between two states, enabling or disabling a feature, setting, or functionality. The switch component is designed to visually represent the current state and display whether a particular feature is turned on or off.

The switch component is a boolean control element that sets the value to true or false. For example, it is used to toggle a feature ON or OFF, such as muting or unmuting sound, or enabling or disabling Bluetooth or WiFi.

## Usage {#reasons-to-use-switch}

The common reasons to use switch in an Adaptive Form are:

- **User interaction**: Users can interact with the switch component by clicking or tapping on it.

- **States**: The switch component has two states: ON and OFF. The initial state of the switch component depends on the default setting or the current status of the feature that it controls.

- **Visual representation**: The switch component visually reflects its current state by changing color or position.

- **Control functionality**: The switch component is used to enable or disable specific functionality in an AEM Form. For example, it allows users to turn a feature on or off.

     ![Rich text support for options](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/switch-optipn-rich-text.png)

    Once you select the checkbox for **Allow Rich Text for options** formatting options become visible to style the component's options. To access all available formatting options, you can click on the `Fullscreen` ![Fullscreen icon](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/fullscreen-icon.png) tab.
    
    ![Rich text support for options](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/switch-richtext-for-display.png)
      
- **Bind Reference** - A bind reference is a reference to a data element that is stored in an external data source and used in a form. The bind reference allows you to dynamically bind data to form fields, so that the form can display the most up-to-date data from the data source. For example, a bind reference can be used to display a customer's name and address in a form, based on the customer's ID entered into the form. The bind reference can also be used to update the data source with data entered into the form. In this way, AEM Forms enable you to create forms that interact with external data sources, providing a seamless user experience for collecting and managing data.
- **Mark as Unbound Form Element**: Select the option to configure a form field not linked to any schema. This option allows you to save data without updating the data source. It also enables you to handle data in a custom way, separate from standard database integration.
- **Data type of submitted value**:  This option specifies the data type of the value sent when any option is selected. If the **data type of submitted value** is set to `Number` and you add string data to **Data Value** ​​on the **Options** tab, the screen displays a `Value type mismatch` error message.
- **Hide Component** - Select the option to hide the component from the form. The component remains accessible for other purposes, such as using it for calculations in the Rule Editor. This is useful when you need to store information that doesn't need to be seen or directly changed by the user. 

- **Disable Component** - Select the option to disable or lock the component. The disabled component is not active or editable by the end user. The user can see the value of the field but cannot modify it. The component remains accessible for other purposes, such as using it for calculations in the Rule Editor.

- **Default Value**: This option allows you to add a default value in a form field. If **Disabled Component** or **Read-Only Component** is selected, the default value is displayed on the screen. If no value is entered by user in the form field, this value is submitted at the time of form submission.

### Validation Tab {#validation-tab}

![Validation tab](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/switch-validation.png)

You cannot select the **Hide Component** or **Disable Component**  in the **Basic** tab when this option is selected.

- **Error Message** - This option allows you to enter a message that is displayed if the **Required** checkbox is checked and the form field is left blank.

- **Script Validation Message** - This option allows you to enter a message to be displayed if the script validation fails.

### Help Content Tab {#helpcontent-tab}

![Help Content tab](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/switch-help.png)

- **Short description** - A short description is a brief text explanation that provides additional information or clarification about the purpose of a specific form field. It helps the user understand what type of data should be entered into the field and can provide guidelines or examples to help ensure that the information entered is valid and meets the desired criteria. By default, short descriptions remain hidden. Enable the **Always show short description** option to display it below the component.

- **Always show short description** - Enable the option to display the Short description below the component.

Help text provides more detailed information than a form field's label or placeholder text, and is designed to help the user understand the requirements or constraints of the field. It can also offer suggestions or examples to make filling out the form easier and more accurate.

### Accessibility Tab {#accessibility-tab}

![Accessibility tab](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/switch-accessibility.png)

- **Text for screen readers** - Text for screen readers refers to additional text that is intended to be read by assistive technologies, such as screen readers, used by visually impaired individuals. This text provides an audio description of the form field's purpose, and can include information about the field's title, description, name, and any relevant messages (Custom text). The screen reader text helps ensure that the form is accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments, and provides them with a complete understanding of the form field and its requirements.
