# Button Component {#button-component-adaptive-forms-core-component}

<span class="preview"> This article contains content about the  **Allow Rich Text for Title**  feature, a pre-release feature. The pre-release feature is accessible only through our [pre-release channel](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/release-notes/prerelease.html#new-features).</span>

A button in an Adaptive Form is a UI element that allows users to initiate an action when clicked. The button element can be used to submit a form, reset a form, or perform other actions such as navigating to a different page or triggering custom code. The button can be created using the Button Core Component.

The Adaptive Forms Rule Editor allows users to set various actions for the button component. These actions include opening a website, showing or hiding form components, adding an instance of a panel or component, submitting or resetting a form, and more.

Adaptive Forms feature separate components for the [Submit button](/help/adaptive-forms/components/submit-button.md) and [Reset button](/help/adaptive-forms/components/reset-button.md), allowing users to conveniently submit or reset a form. The Button component can be flexibly configured to execute these actions based on specific needs.

Users can access the complete list of actions supported for the button component by using the Adaptive Forms Rule Editor. The Rule Editor allows users to create rules that are triggered by various events, such as when a button is clicked, when a form is loaded, or when a field value changes. These rules can then be used to perform various actions, such as showing or hiding components, setting field values, or submitting the form. 

**Example**

## Usage {#reasons-to-use-button}

There are several reasons why it is beneficial to include a button in an Adaptive Form, including:

-   **Form submission**: A button is typically used to submit a form, allowing users to send the data they have entered to the server for processing.

-   **Form reset**: Buttons can also be used to reset a form, clearing all the data entered by the user.

-   **Navigation**: Buttons can be used to navigate between different sections of a form or different pages on a website.

-   **Event Handling**: Buttons can be used to trigger different events like opening a website, show/hide components, add an instance of a panel or component to the button.

-   **Interactivity**: Buttons can be used to create interactive forms. For example, a button can be used to open a modal dialog or to toggle a section of the form.

## Configure Dialog {#configure-dialog}

You can easily customize your button experience for visitors with the Configure Dialog. You can also define button properties with ease for a seamless user experience.

### Basic Tab {#basic-tab}

![Basic Tab](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/button_basictab.png)

-   **Name** - You can identify a form component easily with its unique name both in the form and in the rule editor, but the name must not contain spaces or special characters.

-   **Title** - With its Title, you can easily identify a component in a form and by default, the title appears on top of the component. If you do not add a title, the name of the component is displayed instead of the title text.

- **Allow Rich Text for Title** - This features enables users to format plain text titles, incorporating features like bold, italic, underlined text, various fonts, font sizes, colors, and additional option to enhance visual presentation and customization. It offers greater flexibility and creative control in making titles stand out within documents, websites, or applications.  
    Upon selecting the checkbox for **Allow Rich Text for Title** , formatting options become visible to style the component's title. To access all available formatting options, you can click on the ![Fullscreen icon](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/fullscreen-icon.png) tab.
     
     ![Rich text support](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/richtext-support-title.png)
     
-   **Bind Reference** - A bind reference is a reference to a data element that is stored in an external data source and used in a form. The bind reference allows you to dynamically bind data to form fields, so that the form can display the most up-to-date data from the data source. For example, a bind reference can be used to display a customer's name and address in a form, based on the customer's ID entered into the form. The bind reference can also be used to update the data source with data entered into the form. In this way, AEM Forms enables you to create forms that interact with external data sources, providing a seamless user experience for collecting and managing data.

<!--   **Document of Record bind reference** - This option allows you to associate an Adaptive Form field with Document of Record field. When user enters any value in a linked field of an Adaptive Form that value also appears in the linked field of the corresponding Document of Record. For example, a Document of Record bind reference can be used to display a customer's name and address in a Document of Record, based on the customer's ID entered into the form. In this way, AEM Forms enables you to generate Document of Record and offers a seamless user experience for collecting and managing data.-->

- **Mark as Unbound Form Element**: Select the option to configure a form field not linked to any schema. This option allows you to save data without updating the data source. It also enables you to handle data in a custom way, separate from standard database integration.
-   **Hide Component** - Select the option to hide the component from the form. The component remains accessible for other purposes, such as using it for calculations in the Rule Editor. This is useful when you need to store information that doesn't need to be seen or directly changed by the user. 
-   **Disable Component** - Select the option to disable the component. The disabled component is not active or editable by the end user. The user can see the value of the field but cannot modify it. The component remains accessible for other purposes, such as using it for calculations in the Rule Editor.

<!--   **Read-only** - Select the option to make the component non-editable. The user can see the value of the field but cannot modify it. The component remains accessible for other purposes, such as using it for calculations in the Rule Editor.-->

### Help Content Tab {#help-content}

![Help Content tab](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/button_helptab.png)

-   **Short description** - A short description is a brief text explanation that provides additional information or clarification about the purpose of a specific form field. It helps the user understand what type of data should be entered into the field and can provide guidelines or examples to help ensure that the information entered is valid and meets the desired criteria. By default, short descriptions remain hidden. Enable the **Always show short description** option to display it below the component.

-   **Always show short description** - Enable the option to display the Short description below the component.

-   **Help text** -  Help text refers to additional information or guidance that is provided to the user to assist them in filling out a form field correctly. It appears when the user clicks the help icon (i) placed next to the component. Help text provides more detailed information than a form field's label or placeholder text, and is designed to help the user understand the requirements or constraints of the field. It can also offer suggestions or examples to make filling out the form easier and more accurate.

### Accessibility {#accessibility}

![Accessibility tab](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/button_accessibilitytab.png)


-   **Text for screen readers** - Text for screen readers refers to additional text that is specifically intended to be read by assistive technologies, such as screen readers, used by visually impaired individuals. This text provides an audio description of the form field's purpose, and can include information about the field's title, description, name, and any relevant messages (Custom text). The screen reader text helps ensure that the form is accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments, and provides them with a complete understanding of the form field and its requirements. 

## Design Dialog {#design-dialog} 

Design Dialog is used to define and manage CSS styles for the button component.

### Styles Tab {#styles-tab}

The Adaptive Forms Button Core Component supports the AEM [Style System](/help/get-started/authoring.md#component-styling).

![Design Dialog](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/checkbox-style.png)

- **Default CSS Classes**: You can provide a default CSS class for the Adaptive Forms Button Core Component. 

- **Allowed Styles**: You can define styles by providing a name and the CSS class that represents the style. For example, you can create a style named "bold text" and provide the CSS class "font-weight: bold". You can use or apply these styles to an Adaptive Form in Adaptive Forms editor. To apply a style, in Adaptive Forms editor, select the component you want to apply the style to, navigate to the properties dialog, and select the desired style from the **Styles** drop-down list. If you need to update or modify the styles, simply return to the Design Dialog, update the styles in the styles tab, and save the changes.

### Custom Properties 

![Custom Properties Dialog](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/checkbox-customproperties.png)

Custom properties allows you to associate custom attributes (key-value pairs) to an Adaptive Form core component using the form template. The custom properties are reflected in the properties section of the headless rendition of the component. It allows creating dynamic form behavior that adapts based on the custom attributes values. For example, developers can design various renditions of a Headless Forms component for mobile, desktop, or web platforms, significantly enhancing the user experience across a wide array of devices.

- **Group Name**: You can provide a name to identify the custom property group. You can add, delete, or rearrange multiple custom property groups. After adding the custom property group, you can see the following options:

    - **Key-Value Pairs**: You can add multiple custom property names and custom property values by clicking the **Add** button for each custom property group.

    - **Delete**: Tap or click to delete the custom property name and custom property value.

    - **Rearrange**: Tap or click and drag to rearrange the order of the custom property name and custom property value.
