# Checkbox group component {#button-component-adaptive-forms-core-component}

A checkbox group in an Adaptive Form is a set of related checkboxes that allow users to select one or more options from a list. Each checkbox is represented by a Data Value (value used to process items of a checkbox group) and Display value (label for each checkbox item that describes its purpose)

{{traditional-aem}}

**Example**

**Properties Dialog**

![checkbox group property dialog](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/checkbox-group-properties.png)

In this example, Options element is used to group the checkboxes together. The **Display text** element is used to provide a label for an item and **Data Value** is used to specify the value that is sent to the server when the form is submitted. 

Each checkbox option/item has a unique Data value and Display Text attribute. If a user selects the "Son" and "Daughter" checkboxes, the corresponding Data Value is sent to the server when the form is submitted. This data can then be processed by a server-side script to determine which options were selected by the user, and can be used to perform various actions, such as updating other fields in the form or submitting the form data to a server-side script for further processing.

Additionally, The checkbox group can be configured to have different processing values for each option, and this can be set by using Adaptive Forms Rule Editor.

## Usage {#reasons-to-use-check-box-group}

-   **Multiple selections**: A checkbox group allows users to select multiple options from a list, which can be useful in situations where multiple selections are allowed or required.

-   **User experience**: Checkbox group can be used to make the form more user-friendly by providing a clear and intuitive way for users to select multiple options.

-   **Data analysis**: Checkbox group can be used to collect data from various sources and analyze it, or use it as input for further processing.

-   **Surveys**: Checkbox group can be used in surveys to select multiple options for a question.

-   **User preferences**: Checkbox group can be used to collect user preferences for different options.

-   **Bind Reference** - A bind reference is a reference to a data element that is stored in an external data source and used in a form. The bind reference allows you to dynamically bind data to form fields, so that the form can display the most up-to-date data from the data source. For example, a bind reference can be used to display a customer's name and address in a form, based on the customer's ID entered into the form. The bind reference can also be used to update the data source with data entered into the form. In this way, AEM Forms enables you to create forms that interact with external data sources, providing a seamless user experience for collecting and managing data.

- **Mark as Unbound Form Element**: Select the option to configure a form field not linked to any schema. This option allows you to save data without updating the data source. It also enables you to handle data in a custom way, separate from standard database integration.

-  **Data type of submitted value** - This option specifies the data type of the value sent when any option is selected. If the **data type of submitted value** is set to `Number` and you add string data to **Data Value** ​​on the **Options** tab, the screen displays a `Value type mismatch` error message.

-   **Default options** - This option allows you to add pre-selected default values when the form loads. Use the delete icon to remove the added options. If the **data type of submitted value** is set to `Number` and you add string data to **Default options**, the screen displays a `Value type mismatch` error message.
