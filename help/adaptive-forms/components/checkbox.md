# Checkbox component{#checkbox-component}

A checkbox is a graphical user interface element commonly used in software applications and forms to allow users to make a binary choice between two options: checked (selected) or unchecked (deselected). 

A checkbox is usually represented as a small square that can be toggled on or off by clicking or tapping it. When a checkbox is checked, it displays a checkmark to show that the associated option or feature is active or enabled.

>[!NOTE]
>
> For AEM 6.5 Forms, this component was introduced with AEM 6.5 Forms Service Pack 19 (6.5.19.0).

## Usage {#reasons-to-use-checkbox}

The common reasons to use checkbox in an Adaptive Form are:

- **Ease of Use**: Checkboxes are visually clear and provide a straightforward way to make binary choices. They are intuitive and easy to understand, making them user-friendly.

- **Consent and Agreement**: Checkboxes are used to obtain user consent for various purposes, for example accepting terms and conditions, subscribing to newsletters, or confirming age verification. They make it clear that the user is actively agreeing to something.

- **Visual Confirmation**: Checked checkboxes provide a visual confirmation to users that their selection has been recorded. This feedback helps prevent user errors and ensures they know their choices have been registered.

- **Error Prevention**: Checkboxes reduce the errors probability by allowing users to review and confirm the choices before form submission.

- **Hide Title** - Select the option to hide the component's Title.

- **Bind Reference** - A bind reference is a reference to a data element that is stored in an external data source and used in a form. The bind reference allows you to dynamically bind data to form fields, so that the form can display the most up-to-date data from the data source. For example, a bind reference can be used to display a customer's name and address in a form, based on the customer's ID entered into the form. The bind reference can also be used to update the data source with data entered into the form. In this way, AEM Forms enable you to create forms that interact with external data sources, providing a seamless user experience for collecting and managing data.

- **Mark as Unbound Form Element**: Select the option to configure a form field not linked to any schema. This option allows you to save data without updating the data source. It also enables you to handle data in a custom way, separate from standard database integration.

- **Data type of submitted value**:  This option specifies the data type of the value sent when any option is selected. If the **data type of submitted value** is set to `Number` and you add string data to **Data Value** ​​on the **Options** tab, the screen displays a `Value type mismatch` error message.

- **Hide Component** - Select the option to hide the component from the form. The component remains accessible for other purposes, such as using it for calculations in the Rule Editor. This is useful when you need to store information that doesn't need to be seen or directly changed by the user.

The user can see the value of the field but cannot modify it. The component remains accessible for other purposes, such as using it for calculations in the Rule Editor.
<!-- - **Read-only** - Select the option to make the component non-editable. The user can see the value of the field but cannot modify it. The component remains accessible for other purposes, such as using it for calculations in the Rule Editor.-->
