# Date picker component{#date-picker-adaptive-forms-core-component}

A date picker component in an Adaptive form is a user interface element that allows users to select a date from a calendar or by manually entering a date in a specific format. The date picker component can be configured to have different formatting, validation, and default values.

## Configure Dialog {#configure-dialog}

You can easily customize your date picker experience for visitors with the Configure Dialog. You can also define date picker options with ease for a seamless user experience.

### Basic Tab {#basic-tab}

![Basic tab](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/datepicker_basictab.png)

-   **Name** - The name uniquely identifies the component in the rule editor. Special characters and spaces are not allowed in the name strings.

-   **Title** - Title is a string that appears at the top of a component in an Adaptive Form. Title uniquely identifies the component in the tree structure of an Adaptive Form. If you do not add a title, the name of the component is displayed instead of the title text.
- **Allow Rich Text for Title** - This features enables users to format plain text titles, incorporating features like bold, italic, underlined text, various fonts, font sizes, colors, and additional option to enhance visual presentation and customization. It offers greater flexibility and creative control in making titles stand out within documents, websites, or applications.  
    Upon selecting the checkbox for **Allow Rich Text for Title** , formatting options become visible to style the component's title. To access all available formatting options, you can click on the ![Fullscreen icon](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/fullscreen-icon.png) tab.
     
     ![Rich text support](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/richtext-support-title.png)

-   **Hide Title** - Select this option to hide title of the component type in an Adaptive Form.

-   **Placeholder text** - Placeholder text in a form component refers to a short label or prompt that appears within an input field as a hint to the user on what type of information is expected to be entered in that field. Placeholder text disappears when the user starts typing into the field and reappears if the field is left empty. It provides a visual cue to the user, but does not act as a permanent label or value for the field.
- **Bind Reference** - A bind reference is a reference to a data element that is stored in an external data source and used in a form. The bind reference allows you to dynamically bind data to form fields, so that the form can display the most up-to-date data from the data source. For example, a bind reference can be used to display a customer's name and address in a form, based on the customer's ID entered into the form. The bind reference can also be used to update the data source with data entered into the form. In this way, AEM Forms enable you to create forms that interact with external data sources, providing a seamless user experience for collecting and managing data.

- **Mark as Unbound Form Element**: Select the option to configure a form field not linked to any schema. This option allows you to save data without updating the data source. It also enables you to handle data in a custom way, separate from standard database integration.

-   **Hide Component** - Select the option to hide the component from the form. The component remains accessible for other purposes, such as using it for calculations in the Rule Editor. This is useful when you need to store information that doesn't need to be seen or directly changed by the user. 
-   **Disable Component** - Select the option to disable the component. The disabled component is not active or editable by the end user. The user can see the value of the field but cannot modify it. The component remains accessible for other purposes, such as using it for calculations in the Rule Editor.
-   **Read-only** - Select the option to make the component non-editable. The user can see the value of the field but cannot modify it. The component remains accessible for other purposes, such as using it for calculations in the Rule Editor.
-   **Default Date** - This option allows you to add a date to the form field. The entered date appears by default at the place of the component. If no date is entered by user, this value is submitted at the time of form submission. In case **Disabled Component** or **Read-Only Component** is selected, the default date is displayed on the screen and submitted at the time of form submission.


### Validation Tab {#validation-tab}

![Validation tab](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/datepicker_validation.png)

-   **Required** - Select this option, if you want to display the component in an Adaptive Form. After selecting the option, you must make a selection before proceeding with a form submission. You cannot select the **Hide Component** or **Disable Component** in the **Basic** tab when this option is selected.

-   **Error Message** - This option allows you to enter a message that is displayed if the **Required** checkbox is checked and the form field is left blank.

-   **Script Validation Message** - This option allows you to enter a message to be displayed if the script validation fails.

-   **Minimum Error Message** - The **Minimum Error Message** dialog box allows you to add a custom error message to be displayed, if you enter a date earlier than the date specified in the **Minimum Date** option.
-   **Exclude minimum date** - This option allows to omit the minimum date in a given range or set of dates.

-   **Maximum Date** - This option allows you to enter the maximum required date. If you enter a date later than the date specified in Maximum Date, an error message appears on the screen. The **Maximum Error Message** dialog box allows you to add a custom error message.

-   **Maximum Error Message** - The **Maximum Error Message** dialog box allows you to add a custom error message to be displayed, if you enter a date later than the date specified in the **Maximum Date** option.

-   **Exclude maximum date** - This option allows to omit the maximum date in a given range or set of dates.

### Help Content Tab {#help-content-tab}

![Help Content tab](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/datepicker_helptab.png)

-   **Short description** - A short description is a brief text explanation that provides additional information or clarification about the purpose of a specific form field. It helps the user understand what type of data should be entered into the field and can provide guidelines or examples to help ensure that the information entered is valid and meets the desired criteria. By default, short descriptions remain hidden. Enable the **Always show short description** option to display it below the component.

-   **Always show short description**- Enable the option to display the Short description below the component.

-   **Help text** -  Help text refers to additional information or guidance that is provided to the user to assist them in filling out a form field correctly. It appears when the user clicks the help icon (i) placed next to the component. Help text provides more detailed information than a form field's label or placeholder text, and is designed to help the user understand the requirements or constraints of the field. It can also offer suggestions or examples to make filling out the form easier and more accurate.


### Accessibility Tab {#accessibility-tab}

![Accessibility tab](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/datepicker_accessibilitytab.png)

- **Text for screen readers** - Text for screen readers refers to additional text that is specifically intended to be read by assistive technologies, such as screen readers, used by visually impaired individuals. This text provides an audio description of the form field's purpose, and can include information about the field's title, description, name, and any relevant messages (Custom text). The screen reader text helps ensure that the form is accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments, and provides them with a complete understanding of the form field and its requirements.
