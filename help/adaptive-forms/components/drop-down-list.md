# Drop-down list component{#drop-down-list-adaptive-forms-core-component}

A drop-down list in an Adaptive form allows users to select one or more option from a list of predefined options. The options can be of type String, Number, or Boolean. Additionally, the drop-down list component can be configured to have different validation and default values.

**Example**
![example](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/drop-down-list.png)

## Usage {#reasons-to-use-drop-down-list}

There are several reasons why it is beneficial to include a drop-down list in an Adaptive Form, including:

-   **Long list of options**: Drop-down lists are useful for situations where there is a long list of options are available for a field. They take up less space on the form than a list of radio buttons or checkboxes, and can be less overwhelming for users.

-   **Consistency**: Drop-down lists provide consistency in the design and layout of the form, making it more intuitive and easy for users to navigate.

-   **Clarity**: Drop-down lists can make the form more clear and easy to understand by providing a clear and concise list of options.

-   **User experience**: Drop-down lists can be used to make the form more user-friendly by providing a clear and intuitive way for users to select options.

-   **Data analysis**: Drop-down lists can be used to collect data from various sources and analyze it, or use it as input for further processing.

**Properties Dialog**

![properties dialog](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/drop-down-list-properties.png)

In this example, Options element is used to define the list items. The **Display text** element is used to provide a label for list items and **Data Value** is used to specify the value that is sent to the server when the form is submitted. 

Each drop-down list option has a unique Data value and Display Text attribute. If a user selects the "Red" option, the corresponding Data Value is sent to the server when the form is submitted. This data can then be processed by a server-side script to determine which options were selected by the user, and can be used to perform various actions, such as updating other fields in the form or submitting the form data to a server-side script for further processing.

Additionally, The drop-down list can be configured to have different processing values for each option, and this can be set by using Adaptive Forms Rule Editor.

    In the **Options** tab, you can add data values and display text pairs using the **Add** button. Once a new option is added, the following actions are performed:
    
    - **Data Value** - This option allows to enter the content to submit when an option is selected.

-   **Placeholder text** - Placeholder text in a form component refers to a short label or prompt that appears within an input field as a hint to the user on what type of information is expected to be entered in that field. Placeholder text disappears when the user starts typing into the field and reappears if the field is left empty. It provides a visual cue to the user, but does not act as a permanent label or value for the field.

For example, a bind reference can be used to display a customer's name and address in a form, based on the customer's ID entered into the form. The bind reference can also be used to update the data source with data entered into the form. In this way, AEM Forms enables you to create forms that interact with external data sources, providing a seamless user experience for collecting and managing data.
