# Form title component{#title-input-adaptive-forms-core-component}

In an Adaptive Form, a "title" refers to the text that appears at the top of the form, typically below the header. The title is specified using the Title component. This component can be added to the form layout, and its text can be edited to match the purpose or topic of the form. The title serves as a label or brief description of the form to the user, and it helps to distinguish the form from others.

## Usage {#reasons-to-use-title-in-an-adaptive-form}

There are several reasons why it's a good practice to use a title in a form:

-   **Clarity**: A title clearly identifies the purpose of the form, which helps users understand what information they need to provide.

-   **Organization**: A title can help to organize forms by topic or purpose, which makes it easier for users to find the form they need.

-   **Accessibility**: A title is a key element for users with accessibility needs, as it is read out loud by screen readers, helping users understand the context of the form.

-   **Branding**: A title can also be used to display a company or organization's name, which helps to create a sense of trust and familiarity with the user.

-   **Navigation**: A title can also be useful to navigate through the form, especially if the form is long or complex.

-   **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**: Having a title on the form also helps in SEO, as search engines use the title to determine the relevance of a web page to a search query.

Overall, the title of a form is an important aspect of the user experience and it should be used to provide a clear and concise label for the form that helps users understand the context and purpose of the form.

The edit dialog allows the content author to define the title text as well as select the heading level.

-   **Title** - With its Title, you can easily identify a component in a form and by default, the title appears on top of the component. If you do not add a title, the name of the component is displayed instead of the title text.

    - If left blank, a unique ID is automatically generated for you and can be found by inspecting the resulting page.
    - If an ID is specified, it is the responsibility of the author to make sure that it is unique.
    - Changing the ID can have an impact on CSS, JS and Data Layer tracking.
