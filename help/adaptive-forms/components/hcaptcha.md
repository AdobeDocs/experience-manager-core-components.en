hCaptcha&reg; service protects your forms from bots, spam, and automated abuse. It poses a checkbox widget challenge and evaluates the user response to determine if it's a human or a bot interacting with the form. It prevents the user to proceed if the test fails and helps make online transactions secure by keeping bots from posting spam or malicious activities.

## Usage {#usage}

There are several reasons why it is beneficial to include a hCaptcha challenge in a form submission process, these are:

- **Bot Prevention**: It ensures that the form is being submitted by a human, reducing spam and automated submissions.

- **Security**: It adds an extra layer of security, verifying the legitimacy of each form submission and protecting against malicious attacks.

- **Data Integrity**: By preventing multiple or fraudulent submissions, It help to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the data collected through the form.

- **User Verification**: It verifies the identity of the user submitting the form, ensuring that only authenticated users can complete sensitive transactions.

- **Load Management**: It helps manage server load by controlling the rate of form submissions, preventing system overload during high-traffic periods.
