# Numeric box component{#number-input-adaptive-forms-core-component}

A Numeric Box component in an Adaptive form is a type of form field that allows users to input numerical values. The component is typically represented by a text field with a up and down arrow for incrementing and decrementing the number.

It can also be used with attributes like min, max, step, value, and more. These attributes can be used to set the minimum and maximum values allowed in the field, the step interval for incrementing or decrementing the number, and the default value of the field.

This component can be used to gather numerical data like age, quantity, and more. It can also be used to perform mathematical operations like addition and  subtraction. This component can also be used to validate the numerical data entered by the user.

For accessibility, it is important to specify 'label' that describes the purpose of the number input field, and what kind of input is expected.

## Configure Dialog {#configure-dialog}

You can easily customize your number input experience for visitors with the Configure Dialog. You can also define number input options with ease for a seamless user experience.

### Basic Tab {#basic-tab}

![Basic Tab](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/numberinput_basictab.png)

-   **Name** - You can identify a form component easily with its unique name both in the form and in the rule editor, but the name must not contain spaces or special characters.

-   **Title** - With its Title, you can easily identify a component in a form and by default, the title appears on top of the component. If you do not add a title, the name of the component is displayed instead of the title text.
- **Allow Rich Text for Title** - This features enables users to format plain text titles, incorporating features like bold, italic, underlined text, various fonts, font sizes, colors, and additional option to enhance visual presentation and customization. It offers greater flexibility and creative control in making titles stand out within documents, websites, or applications.   
    Upon selecting the checkbox for **Allow Rich Text for Title** , formatting options become visible to style the component's title. To access all available formatting options, you can click on the ![Fullscreen icon](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/fullscreen-icon.png) tab.
     
     ![Rich text support](/help/adaptive-forms/assets/richtext-support-title.png)

-   **Hide Title** - Select the option to hide the component's Title.
- **Placeholder Text** - Placeholder text in a form component refers to a short label or prompt that appears within an input field as a hint to the user on what type of information is expected to be entered in that field. Placeholder text disappears when the user starts typing into the field and reappears if the field is left empty. It provides a visual cue to the user, but does not act as a permanent label or value for the field.
- **Bind Reference** - A bind reference is a reference to a data element that is stored in an external data source and used in a form. The bind reference allows you to dynamically bind data to form fields, so that the form can display the most up-to-date data from the data source. For example, a bind reference can be used to display a customer's name and address in a form, based on the customer's ID entered into the form. The bind reference can also be used to update the data source with data entered into the form. In this way, AEM Forms enable you to create forms that interact with external data sources, providing a seamless user experience for collecting and managing data.
- **Mark as Unbound Form Element**: Select the option to configure a form field not linked to any schema. This option allows you to save data without updating the data source. It also enables you to handle data in a custom way, separate from standard database integration.
- **Hide Component** - Select the option to hide the component from the form. The component remains accessible for other purposes, such as using it for calculations in the Rule Editor. This is useful when you need to store information that doesn't need to be seen or directly changed by the user. 
- **Disable Component** - Select the option to disable the component. The disabled component is not active or editable by the end user. The user can see the value of the field but cannot modify it. The component remains accessible for other purposes, such as using it for calculations in the Rule Editor.
-   **Read-only** - Select the option to make the component non-editable The user can see the value of the field but cannot modify it. The component remains accessible for other purposes, such as using it for calculations in the Rule Editor.
-   **Number Type** - This option allows you to select the type of numeric values ​​allowed in the form field. You can select either Decimal or Integer types from the drop-down menu. 
-   **Default Value** - This option allows you to add a default value in a form field. If **Disabled Component** or **Read-Only Component** is selected, the default value is displayed on the screen. If no value is entered by user in the form field, this value is submitted at the time of form submission
