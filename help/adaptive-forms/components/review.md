# Review Component

The Review Component in Adaptive Forms allows users to review and verify the information they have entered before submitting the form. It serves as a summary page, providing a read-only view of all fields and their values in a structured and user-friendly format. This feature ensures that users can identify and correct any errors or omissions before finalizing their submission, enhancing the overall form experience. By clicking the edit icon, they can modify the entered information before form submission.

    - When users select the **Panel** option, they can edit all fields within a specific section (panel).
    - When users select the **Field and Panel** option, they can click the edit icon next to a field to modify specific information or next to a panel to edit all fields within that panel.

## Usecase

Take an example of a **Loan Application Form** consisting of four tabs, where each tab collects specific information about the user:

- **Personal Details**: Collects the user's basic personal details, such as name, date of birth, contact information, and address.

- **Loan Details**: Gathers information related to the loan, including the type of loan, desired amount, repayment period, and automatically calculated fields like interest rate and monthly EMI.

- **Additional Documents**: Allows the user to upload required documents, such as ID proof, address proof, and income proof. It also includes a declaration checkbox to confirm agreement with the terms.

- **Review and Submit Form**: Features a Review Component summarizing all inputs from the previous tabs. Users can verify and edit their data before submitting the form. This tab also includes the **Submit** button to submit the application.

The video below demonstrates how to configure the **Review** component so that it provides the user with the flexibility to edit information:
