### Technical Details {#technical-details}

The latest technical documentation about the Carousel Component [can be found on GitHub](https://adobe.com/go/aem_cmp_tech_carousel_v1).

Further details about developing Core Components can be found in the [Core Components developer documentation](/help/developing/overview.md).

## Deep Linking to a Panel {#deep-linking}

The Carousel, [Tabs,](tabs.md) and [Accordion Components](accordion.md) support linking directly to a panel within the component.

To do this:

1. View the page with the component using the **[View as Published](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/fundamentals/editing-content.html#view-as-published)** option in the page editor.
1. Inspect the content of the page and identify the ID of the panel.
   * For example `id="carousel-bfe4fa6647-item-47f1a7ca67-tabpanel"`
1. The ID becomes the anchor you can append to the URL using a hash (`#`).
   * For example `https://wknd.site/content/wknd/language-masters/en/magazine/western-australia.html#carousel-bfe4fa6647-item-47f1a7ca67-tabpanel`

Navigating to the URL with the panel ID as anchor, the browser will scroll directly to the particular component and display the specified panel. If the panel is configured not to be displayed by default, it will be scrolled to automatically.

## Carousel and Responsive Design {#responsive-design}

All Core Components are designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

Some some advanced components like the Carousel Component may require specific consideration within the context of the implementing project in order to maintain responsiveness in all conditions. Please see the document [Responsive Design of the Core Components](/help/responsive.md) for more information.

## Edit Dialog {#edit-dialog}

The edit dialog allows the content author to add, rename, and rearrange slides as well as define the auto-transition settings.

### Items Tab {#items-tab}

![Items tab of the edit dialog of the Carousel Component](/help/assets/carousel-edit-items.png)

Use the **Add** button to open the component selector to choose which component to add as a tab. Once added, an entry is added to the list, which contains the following columns:

* **Icon** - The icon of the component type of the tab for easy identification in the list. Mouse over to see the full component name as a tooltip.
* **Description** - The description used as the text of the tab, defaulting to the name of the component selected for the tab.
* **Delete** - Tap or click to delete the tab from the tabs component.
* **Reorder** - Tap or click and drag to order the tabs.

>[!TIP]
>
>If the viewport of the page is reduced so that the edit dialog becomes full screen, the **Add** button will be hidden. Components can still be added to the Carousel Component by [dragging from the components browser and dropping on the Carousel Component in the page editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/fundamentals/editing-content.html#inserting-a-component-from-the-components-browser).

### Properties Tab {#properties-tab}

![Properties tab of the edit dialog of the Carousel Component](/help/assets/carousel-edit-properties.png)

On the **Properties** tab, the content author can set the slides to automatically transition.

* **Active Item** - The content author can define which tab is active when the page is loaded. 
* **Automatically transition slides** - When active, the component will automatically advance to the next slide after a specified delay.
* **Transition Delay** - When Automatically transition slides is selected, this value is used to define the delay between transitions (in milliseconds).
* **Disable automatic pause on hover** - When **Automatically transition slides** is selected, the carousel transition will automatically pause whenever the cursor hovers over the carousel. Select this option so that the transition will not pause.
* **ID** - This option allows to control the unique identifier of the component in the HTML and in the [Data Layer](/help/developing/data-layer/overview.md).
  * If left blank, a unique ID is automatically generated for you and can be found by inspecting the resulting page.
  * If an ID is specified, it is the responsibility of the author to make sure that it is unique.
  * Changing the ID can have an impact on CSS, JS and Data Layer tracking.

![Select panel icon](/help/assets/select-panel-icon.png)

Once selecting the **Select Panel** option in the component toolbar, the configured slides are displayed as a drop-down.

* The list is ordered by the assigned arrangement of the slides and is reflected in the numbering.
* The component type of the slide is displayed first, followed by the description of the slide in lighter font.
