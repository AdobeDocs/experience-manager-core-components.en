## Design Dialog {#design-dialog}

The design dialog allows the template author to define the options available to the content author who uses the Container Component.

### Allowed Components Tab {#allowed-components-tab}

The **Allowed Components** tab is used to define which components can be added as items to the Container Component by the content author.

The Allowed Components tab functions in the same way as the tab of the same name when [defining the policy and properties of a Layout Container in the Template Editor.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/features/templates.html)

### Default Components Tab {#default-components-tab}

The Default Components tab is used to define which component is added to the component when a particular asset type is dropped on the container, similar to [how default components are defined on the page template](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/features/templates.html).

### Responsive Settings Tab {#responsive-settings-tab}
