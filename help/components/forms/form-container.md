# Form Container Component {#form-container-component}

The Core Component Form Container Component allows for the creation of simple submission forms.

## Usage {#usage}

The form Container Component enables the building of simple information submission forms and features by supporting simple WCM forms and by using a nested structure to allow additional form components.

By using the [configure dialog](#configure-dialog) the content editor can define the action triggered by form submission, the URl that should handle the submission, and whether a workflow should be triggered. The template author can use the [design dialog](#design-dialog) to define the allowed components and their mappings similar to the design dialog for the [standard layout container in the template editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/features/templates.html).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The core components Form Container Component only supports the use of core components form components (button, text, hidden, etc.). Using [foundation components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/authoring/siteandpage/default-components-foundation.html) form components within the core components form container (and vice versa) is not supported.

## Configure Dialog {#configure-dialog}

The configure dialog allows the content author to define what actions are taken when the component is submitted.

Depending on the selected **Action Type**, the available options within the container will change. The available action types are:

* [Post Form Data](#post-data)
* [Mail](#mail)
* [Store Content](#store-content)

Regardless of the type, there are [general settings](#general-settings) that apply to each action.

### Post Form Data {#post-data}

When the form is submitted, the post form data action type will pass the submitted data on to a third party as JSON for processing.

* **Endpoint** - The fully-qualified HTTPS service that will process the data
* **Error Message** - Message to display if the submission is not successful

>[!TIP]
>There are additional timeout options which a system administrator can adjust to handle the processing of forwarded form data. [See the technical documentation on GitHub for more information.](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components/tree/master/content/src/content/jcr_root/apps/core/wcm/components/form/actions/rpc)

### Mail {#mail}

When the form is submitted, the mail action type will send an email to designated recipients.

![Mail options in Form Container Component's edit dialog](/help/assets/form-container-edit-mail.png)

* **Subject** - The subject of the email that will be sent on form submission
* **From** - The from email address of the email that will be send on form submission
* **To** - The addresses of the recipients who will receive an email upon form submission
  * Tap or click the **Add** button to add additional addresses
  * Tap or click the **Delete** button to remove an email address
* **CC** - The addresses of recipients who will receive a carbon copy the email sent upon form submission
  * Tap or click the **Add** button to add additional addresses
  * Tap or click the **Delete** button to remove an email address

### Store Content {#store-content}

When the form is submitted, the content of the form will be stored in a designated repository location.

![Store content options in Form Container's edit dialog](/help/assets/form-container-edit-store.png)

* **Content Path** - Content repository path where submitted content is stored
* **View Data** - Tap or click to view stored submitted data as JSON
* **Start Workflow** - Configure to start a workflow with the stored content as payload upon form submission

>[!NOTE]
>
>In order to make the management of user-data simpler and to enforce separation of concerns, it is generally not recommended to store user-generated content within the repository.
>
>Instead use the [Post Form Data](#post-data) action type to pass user content on to a dedicated service provider.

### General Settings {#general-settings}

Regardless of the action type selected, a thank you page can always be defined.

![General options in Form Container Component's edit dialog](/help/assets/form-container-edit-general.png)

* **Thank you page** - The user will be redirected to the specified page after completion of the form submission.
  * Use the Selection Dialog to select a resource within AEM.
  * If the thank you page is not in AEM, specify the absolute URL. Non-absolute URLs will be interpreted relative to AEM.
  * Leave blank to redisplay the form after submission.
* **ID** - This option allows to control the unique identifier of the component in the HTML and in the [Data Layer](/help/developing/data-layer/overview.md).
  * If left blank, a unique ID is automatically generated for you and can be found by inspecting the resulting page.
  * If an ID is specified, it is the responsibility of the author to make sure that it is unique.
  * Changing the ID can have an impact on CSS, JS and Data Layer tracking.

## Design Dialog {#design-dialog}

The design dialog allows the template author to define the allowed components and their mappings for the container similar to the design dialog for the [standard layout container in the template editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/features/templates.html).

### Styles Tab {#styles-tab}

The Form Container Component supports the AEM [Style System](/help/get-started/authoring.md#component-styling).
