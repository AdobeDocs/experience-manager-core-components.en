# Form Hidden Component{#form-hidden-component}

The Core Component Form Hidden component allows for the display of a hidden field.

## Usage {#usage}

The Core Component Form Hidden Component allows for the creation of hidden fields to pass information about the current page back to AEM and is intended to be used along with the [form container component](form-container.md).

The field properties can be defined by the content editor in the [configure dialog](form-hidden.md).

## Version and Compatibility {#version-and-compatibility}

The current version of the Form Hidden Component is v2, which was introduced with release 2.0.0 of the Core Components in January 2018, and is described in this document.

### Technical Details {#technical-details}

Further details about developing Core Components can be found in the [Core Components developer documentation](/help/developing/overview.md).

## Configure Dialog {#configure-dialog}

The configure dialog allows the content author to define the parameters of the hidden field.

* **Name** - The name of the field, which is submitted with the form data
* **Value** - The value of the field, which is submitted with the form data
* **ID** - This option allows to control the unique identifier of the component in the HTML and in the [Data Layer](/help/developing/data-layer/overview.md).
  * If left blank, a unique ID is automatically generated for you and can be found by inspecting the resulting page.
  * If an ID is specified, it is the responsibility of the author to make sure that it is unique.
  * Changing the ID can have an impact on CSS, JS and Data Layer tracking.

Because the Form Hidden component normally has no visible attributes, the component's placeholder in the editor displays the **Name** and **Value** field values if they are assigned in order to help the author identify the appropriate Form Hidden component.
