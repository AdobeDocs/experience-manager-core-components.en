# List Component{#list-component}

The Core Component List Component allows for the easy creation of dynamic as well as static lists.

## Usage {#usage}

The List Component can be used to create for example a dynamic list of child pages or a static list of arbitrarily defined items. The type of lists available and formatting options can be defined by the template author in the [design dialog](#design-dialog). The content editor can select from available list types and how to format the list elements in the [edit dialog](#edit-dialog).

## Version and Compatibility {#version-and-compatibility}

The current version of the List Component is v4, which was introduced with release 2.22.0 of the Core Components in February 2023, and is described in this document.

The following table details all supported versions of the component, the AEM versions with which the versions of the component is compatible, and links to documentation for previous versions.

## Redirects in Lists {#redirects}

When a page has a redirection target (regardless whether it is pointing to an external URL or to another AEM page), then a list that contains links to that point directly to the URL of the redirection target.

### Example {#redirect-example}

* Create a page A that redirects to page B.
* Create a page C that redirects to `https://aemcomponents.dev`
* On a page D, insert a list component that contains pages A and C
* The respective links that are generated then point directly to page B and `https://aemcomponents.dev`

  * If an ID is specified, it is the responsibility of the author to make sure that it is unique.
  * Changing the ID can have an impact on CSS, JS and Data Layer tracking.
