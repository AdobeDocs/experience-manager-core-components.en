# Table of Contents Component {#table-of-contents-component}

The Table of Contents Component creates a ToC based on the titles in your page content allowing your readers to quickly navigate the page.

## Usage {#usage}

The Table of Contents component offers site visitors the ability to quickly navigate your page's content through an efficiently-generated ToC based on the titles of the pages content.
