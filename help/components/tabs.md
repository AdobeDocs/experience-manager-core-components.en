# Tabs Component {#tabs-component}

The Core Component Tabs Component allows organization of content onto multiple tabs.

## Usage {#usage}

The Tabs Component allows the content author to organize page content within multiple tabs.

The [edit dialog](#edit-dialog) allows the content author to define multiple tabs as well as set the active tab. Using the [design dialog](#design-dialog), the template author can define which components can be added to tabs and customize the styles.

>[!TIP]
>
>Nested tab components (tabs within tabs) are supported.
>
>Simple (non-nested) tab components can be located/selected using the [content tree](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/fundamentals/environment-tools.html#content-tree), however nested tabs can not be.

### Technical Details {#technical-details}

The latest technical documentation about the Tabs Component [can be found on GitHub](https://adobe.com/go/aem_cmp_tech_tabs_v1).

Further details about developing Core Components can be found in the [Core Components developer documentation](/help/developing/overview.md).

## Deep Linking to a Panel {#deep-linking}

The Tabs, [Carousel,](carousel.md) and [Accordion Components](accordion.md) support linking directly to a panel within the component.

To do this:

1. View the page with the component using the **[View as Published](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/fundamentals/editing-content.html#view-as-published)** option in the page editor.
1. Inspect the content of the page and identify the ID of the panel.
   * For example `id="accordion-86196c94d3-item-ca319dbb0b"`
1. The ID becomes the anchor you can append to the URL using a hash (`#`).
   * For example `https://wknd.site/content/wknd/language-masters/en/magazine/western-australia.html#accordion-86196c94d3-item-ca319dbb0b`

Navigating to the URL with the panel ID as anchor, the browser will scroll directly to the particular component and display the specified panel. If the panel is configured to not be expanded by default, it will be expanded automatically.

## Tab and Responsive Design {#responsive-design}

All Core Components are designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

Some some advanced components like the Tab Component may require specific consideration within the context of the implementing project in order to maintain responsiveness in all conditions. Please see the document [Responsive Design of the Core Components](/help/responsive.md) for more information.

## Edit Dialog {#edit-dialog}

The edit dialog allows the content author to create, rename, and rearrange tabs as well as define the active tab.

### Items Tab {#items-tab}

![Tabs Component's edit dialog items tab](/help/assets/tabs-edit-items.png)

Use the **Add** button to open the component selector to choose which component to add as a tab. Once added, an entry is added to the list, which contains the following columns:

* **Icon** - The icon of the component type of the tab for easy identification in the list. Mouse over to see the full component name as a tooltip.
* **Description** - The description used as the text of the tab, defaulting to the name of the component selected for the tab.
* **Delete** - Tap or click to delete the tab from the tab component.
* **Rearrange** - Tap or click and drag to rearrange the order of the tabs.

>[!TIP]
>
>If the viewport of the page is reduced so that the edit dialog becomes full screen, the **Add** button will be hidden. Components can still be added to the Tabs Component by [dragging from the components browser and dropping on the Tabs Component in the page editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/fundamentals/editing-content.html#inserting-a-component).

### Properties Tab {#properties-tab}

![Tabs Component's edit dialog properties tab](/help/assets/tabs-edit-properties.png)

* **Active Item** - The content author can define which tab is active when the page is loaded. 
  * With the **Default** option, the first tab will be selected.
* **ID** - This option allows to control the unique identifier of the component in the HTML and in the [Data Layer](/help/developing/data-layer/overview.md).
  * If left blank, a unique ID is automatically generated for you and can be found by inspecting the resulting page.
  * If an ID is specified, it is the responsibility of the author to make sure that it is unique.
  * Changing the ID can have an impact on CSS, JS and Data Layer tracking.

### Accessibility Tab {#accessibility-tab}

![Tabs Component's edit dialog accessibility tab](/help/assets/tabs-edit-accessibility.png)

On the **Accessibility** tab, values can be set for [ARIA accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) labels for the component.

* **Label** - Value of an ARIA label attribute for the component

## Select Panel {#select-panel}

The content author can use the **Select Panel** option on the component toolbar to change to a different panel for editing as well as to easily rearrange the order of the tabs.

![Select panel icon](/help/assets/select-panel-icon.png)

Once selecting the **Select Panel** option in the component toolbar, the configured tabs are displayed as a drop-down.

* The list is ordered by the assigned arrangement of the tabs and is reflected in the numbering.
* The component type of the tab is displayed first, followed by the description of the tab in lighter font.

![Select panel popover](/help/assets/select-panel-popover.png)

* Tapping or clicking an entry in the dropdown, switches the view in the editor to that tab.
* The tabs can be rearranged in-place by using the drag handles.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Tabs are not selectable by the author when in **Edit** mode. Use **[Preview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/fundamentals/editing-content.html#preview-mode)** mode or the **[View as Published](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/fundamentals/editing-content.html#view-as-published)** option to interact with the tabs as a reader of the published content would.

## Design Dialog {#design-dialog}

The design dialog allows the template author to define which components can be added as items to the tabs component as well as define which custom styles are available to the content author.

### Allowed Components Tab {#allowed-components-tab}

The **Allowed Components** tab is used to define which components can be added as items to the tabs component by the content author.

The Allowed Components tab functions in the same way as the tab of the same name when [defining the policy and properties of a Layout Container in the Template Editor.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/features/templates.html)
