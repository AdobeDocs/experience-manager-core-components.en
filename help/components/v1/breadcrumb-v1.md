# Breadcrumb Component (v1) {#breadcrumb-component-v}

The Core Component Breadcrumb Component is a navigation component that builds a breadcrumb of links based on the page's location in the content hierarchy.

## Usage {#usage}

The Breadcrumb Component displays the position of the current page within the site hierarchy, allowing page visitors to navigate the page hierarchy from their current location. This is often integrated into page headers or footers.

Available options such as the default navigation level and the ability to show the current page or hidden pages can defined by the template author in the [design dialog](#design-dialog). The content editor can then choose if hidden pages should be shown or not and the actual navigation level for the component in the [edit dialog](#edit-dialog).

## Edit Dialog {#edit-dialog}

The edit dialog allows the content author to suppress hidden and active pages in the breadcrumbs as well as the depth in the hierarchy it should display.

![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-34.png)

* **Navigation-Level to start** - Where in the hierarchy the breadcrumb component should start to walk down to the current page. For example in We.Retail:

  * 1 starts at `/content/we-retail`
  * 2 starts at `/content/we-retail/<country>`

* **Show Hidden** - Show pages marked as hidden in the breadcrumb (by default they will not be displayed)
* **Hide Current**- Suppress the current page in the breadcrumb (by default it will be displayed)

## Design Dialog {#design-dialog}

The design dialog allows the template author to define what the default values are for the options to suppress hidden and active pages in the breadcrumbs as well as the depth in the hierarchy it should display.

* **Navigation-Level to start** - Defines the default value for where in the hierarchy the breadcrumb component should start to walk down to the current page when the breadcrumb component is added to a page.
* **Show Hidden** - Defines the default value of the **Show Hidden** option when the breadcrumb component is added to a page.

  * It does not enable or disable the option for the author. It only sets the default value.

* **Hide Current** - Defines the default value of the **Hide Current** option when the breadcrumb component is added to a page.

  * It does not enable or disable the option for the author. It only sets the default value.
