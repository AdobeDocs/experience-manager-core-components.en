### Asset Tab {#asset-tab}

The selection of a download asset is very similar to the functionality of the [Image Component](image-v1.md) and likewise leverages AEM's DAM.

* **Download Asset**
  * Drop an asset from the [asset browser](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/fundamentals/environment-tools.html) or tap the **browse** option to upload from a local file system.
  * Tap or click **Clear** to de-select the currently selected image.
  * Tap or click **Edit** to [mange the renditions of the asset](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/assets/manage/manage-digital-assets.html) in the asset editor.

### Properties Tab {#properties-tab}

![Properties tab of the Download Component's edit dialog](/help/assets/download-edit-properties.png)

* **Title** - Displays as a headline for the download item
  * **Get title from DAM asset** - When selected, the title is automatically populated with the DAM asset's title.
* **Description** - Displays as a descriptive subheadline of the download item
  * **Get description from DAM asset** - When selected, the description is automatically populated with the DAM asset's description.
* **Action Text** - Displays as action text for the download item
  * This field is required when uploading an asset from the file system.
  * **Display inline** - When selected the provided **Action Text** will display inline.
* **ID** - This option allows to control the unique identifier of the component in the HTML and in the [Data Layer](/help/developing/data-layer/overview.md).
  * If left blank, a unique ID is automatically generated for you and can be found by inspecting the resulting page.
  * If an ID is specified, it is the responsibility of the author to make sure that it is unique.
  * Changing the ID can have an impact on CSS, JS and Data Layer tracking.
