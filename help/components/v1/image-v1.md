## Usage {#usage}

The Image Component allows easy placement of image assets and offers in-place editing. It features adaptive image selection with lazy loading as well as cropping for the content author.

## Configure Dialog {#configure-dialog}

In addition to the standard [edit dialog](#edit-dialog) and [design dialog](#design-dialog), the image component offers a configure dialog where the image itself is defined along with its description and basic properties.

![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-50.png)

* **Image asset**
  * Drop an asset from the [asset browser](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/sites/authoring/using/author-environment-tools.html#main-pars_title) or tap the **browse** option to upload from a local file system.
  * Tap or click **Clear** to de-select the currently selected image.
  * Tap or click **Edit** to [mange the renditions of the asset](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/assets/using/managing-assets-touch-ui.html#main-pars_title_19) in the asset editor.

* **Image is decorative** - Check if the image should be ignored by assistive technology and therefore does not require an alternative text. This applies to decorative images only.
* **Alternative text** - Textual alternative of the meaning or function of the image, for visually impaired readers.
* **Link**
  * Link the image to another resource.
  * Use the selection dialog to link to another AEM resource.
  * If not linking to an AEM resource, enter the absolute URL. Non-solute URLs will be interpreted as relative to AEM.

* **Caption** -  Additional information about the image, displayed below the image be default.
* **Display caption as pop-up** -   When checked, the caption won't be displayed below the image, but as a pop-up displayed by some browsers when hovering over the image.

## Edit Dialog {#edit-dialog}

The edit dialog allows the content author to crop, modify the launch map, and zoom the image.

![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-8.png)

* Start Crop

  ![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-9.png)

  Selecting this option opens a drop-down for pre-defined crop proportions.

  * Choose the option **Free Hand** to define your own crop.
  * Choose the option **Remove Crop** to display the original asset.

  Once a crop option is selected, use the blue handles to size the crop on the image.

  ![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-10.png)

* Rotate Right

  ![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-11.png)

  Use this option to rotate the image 90Â° to the right (clockwise).

* Launch Map

  ![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-12.png)

  Use this option to apply a launch map to the image. Selecting this option opens a new window allowing the user select the shape of the map:

  * **Add Rectangular Map**
  * **Add Circular Map**
  * **Add Polygon Map**

    * By default adds a triangle map. Double-click on a line of the shape to add a new blue resize handle on a new side.

  Once a map shape is selected, it is superimposed on the image allowing for resizing. Drag and drop the blue resize handles to adjust the shape.

  ![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-13.png)

  After sizing the launch map, click on it to open a floating toolbar to define the path of the link.

  * **Path**
    * Use the Path Picker option to select a path in AEM
    * If the path is not in AEM, use the absolute URL. Non-absolute paths will be interpreted relative to AEM.

    * **Alt text**
      Alternative description of the path destination
    * **Target**
      * **Same tab**
      * **New tab**
      * **Parent Frame**
      * **Top Frame**

  Tap or click the blue check mark to save, the black x to cancel, and the red trash can to delete the map.

  ![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-14.png)

* Reset Zoom

  ![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-15.png)

  If the image has already been zoomed, use this option to reset the zoom level.

* Open Zoom Slider

  ![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-16.png)

  Use this option to display a slider to control the zoom level of the image.

  ![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-17.png)

The in-place editor can also be used to modify the image. Due to space limitations, only basic options are available in-line. For full edit options, use the full-screen mode.

![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-18.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Image edit operations (crop, flip, rotate) are not supported for GIF images. Any such changes made in edit mode to GIFs will not be persisted.

## Design Dialog {#design-dialog}

The design dialog allows the template author to define the cropping, upload, and rotation uploads the content author has when using this component.

### Main {#main}

On the **Main** tab you can define a list of allowed widths in pixels for the image to automatically load the most appropriate width from the list.

![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-51.png)

Tap or click the Add button to add another size.

* Use the grab handles to re-arrange the order of the sizes.
* Use the delete icon to remove a width.

By default images loading is deferred until they become visible. Select the option **Disable lazy loading** to load the images upon page load.

* **Enable Web Optimized Images** - When checked, the [web-optimized image delivery service](/help/developing/web-optimized-image-delivery.md) will deliver images in the WebP format, reducing image sizes on average by 25%.
  * This option is only available in AEMaaCS.
  * When unchecked or the web-optimized image delivery service is unavailable the [Adaptive Image Servlet](/help/developing/adaptive-image-servlet.md) is used.

### Features {#features}

On the **Features** tab you can define which options are available to the content authors when using the component including upload options, orientation, and cropping options.

* **Enable Web Optimized Images** - when checked, the web-optimized image delivery service will deliver images in the WebP format, reducing image sizes on average by 25%.
  * This option is only available in AEMaaCS.
  * When unchecked or the web-optimized image delivery service is unavailable the [Adaptive Image Servlet](/help/developing/adaptive-image-servlet.md) is used.

* Source

  ![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-19.png)

  Select the option **Allow asset upload from file system** to allow content authors to upload images from his or her local computer. To force content authors to only select assets from AEM, de-select this option.

* Orientation

  ![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-20.png)

  * **Rotate** - Use this option to allow the content author to use the **Rotate Right** option.
  * **Flip**
    Use this option to allow the content author to use the **Flip Horizontally** and **Flip Vertically** options.

  >[!CAUTION]
  >
  >The **Flip** option is disabled by default. Enabling it will display the **Flip Vertically** and **Flip Horizontally** buttons in the edit dialog of the image component, however the feature is not currently supported by AEM and any changes made using these options will not be persisted.

* Cropping

  ![](/help/assets/chlimage_1-21.png)

  Select the option **Allow crop** to allow the content author to crop the image in the component in the edit dialog.
  * Click **Add** to add a pre-defined crop aspect ratio.
  * Enter a descriptive name, which will be shown in the **Start Crop** dropdown.
  * Enter the numerical ratio of the aspect.
  * Use the drag handles to re-arrange the order of the aspect ratios
  * Use the trash can icon to delete an aspect ratio.

  >[!CAUTION]
  >
  >Note that in AEM, crop aspect ratios are defined as **height/width**. This differs from the conventional definition of width/height and is done for legacy compatibility reasons. The content authors will not be aware of any difference as long as you provide a clear name of the ratio since the name is shown in the UI and not the ratio itself.
