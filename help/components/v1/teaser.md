# Teaser Component (v1) {#teaser-component}

The Core Component Teaser Component can show an image, a title, rich-text, and optionally link to further content.

## Usage {#usage}

The Teaser Component allows the content author to easily create a teaser to further content using an image, title, or rich text and linking to further content or other actions.

The template author can use the [design dialog](#design-dialog) to define if the options to create call-to-actions and add links are available as well as disabling various display options. The content author can use the [configure dialog](#configure-dialog) to set an image, define CTAs, set titles and descriptions, and configure links to the individual teaser. The [edit dialog](image-v1.md#edit-dialog) of the [Image Component](image-v1.md) can be accessed to modify the teaser image.
