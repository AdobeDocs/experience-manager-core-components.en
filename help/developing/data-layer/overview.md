# Using the Adobe Client Data Layer with the Core Components {#data-layer-core-components}

The goal of the Adobe Client Data Layer is to reduce the effort to instrument websites by providing a standardized method to expose and access any kind of data for any script.

The Adobe Client Data Layer is platform agnostic, but is fully integrated into the Core Components for use with AEM.

Like the Core Components, the code for the Adobe Client Data Layer is available on GitHub along with its developer documentation. This document gives an overview of how the Core Components interact with the Data Layer, but full technical details are deferred to the GitHub documentation.

>[!TIP]

>For further technical details about the integration of the Adobe Client Data Layer with the Core Components, see the [`DATA_LAYER_INTEGRATION.md`](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components/blob/master/DATA_LAYER_INTEGRATION.md) file in the Core Components repository.

## Installation and Activation {#installation-activation}

As of Core Components release 2.9.0, the Data Layer is distributed with the Core Components as an AEM Client Library and no installation is necessary. All projects generated by the [AEM Project Archetype v. 24+](/help/developing/archetype/overview.md) include an activated Data Layer by default.

To manually activate the Data Layer you must create a [context-aware configuration](/help/developing/context-aware-configs.md) for it:

1. Create the following structure below the `/conf/<mySite>` folder, where `<mySite>` is the name of your Site's project:
   * `/conf/<mySite>/sling:configs/com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.internal.DataLayerConfig`
   * Where each node has a `jcr:primaryType` set to `nt:unstructured`.
1. Add a boolean property called `enabled` and set it to `true`.

    ![Location of DataLayerConfig in WKND Reference Site](/help/assets/datalayer-contextaware-sling-config.png)

    *Location of DataLayerConfig in WKND Reference Site*

1. Add a `sling:configRef` property to the `jcr:content` node of your site below `/content` (e.g. `/content/<mySite>/jcr:content`) and set it to `/conf/<mySite>` from the previous step.

1. Once enabled, you can verify the activation by loading a page of the site outside of the editor, for example by using the **View as Published** option in the editor. Inspect the page source and the `<body>` tag should include an attribute `data-cmp-data-layer-enabled`

    ```html
    <body class="page basicpage" id="page-id" data-cmp-data-layer-enabled>
        <script>
          window.adobeDataLayer = window.adobeDataLayer || [];
          adobeDataLayer.push({
              page: JSON.parse("{\x22page\u002D6c5d4b9fdd\x22:{\x22xdm:language\x22:\x22en\x22,\x22repo:path\x22:\x22\/content\/wknd\/language\u002Dmasters\/en.html\x22,\x22xdm:tags\x22:[],\x22xdm:template\x22:\x22\/conf\/wknd\/settings\/wcm\/templates\/landing\u002Dpage\u002Dtemplate\x22,\x22@type\x22:\x22wknd\/components\/page\x22,\x22dc:description\x22:\x22WKND is a collective of outdoors, music, crafts, adventure sports, and travel enthusiasts that want to share our experiences, connections, and expertise with the world.\x22,\x22dc:title\x22:\x22WKND Adventures and Travel\x22,\x22repo:modifyDate\x22:\x222020\u002D09\u002D29T07:50:13Z\x22}}"),
              event:'cmp:show',
              eventInfo: {
                  path: 'page.page\u002D6c5d4b9fdd'
              }
          });
        </script>
    ```

1. You can also open your browser's developer tools and in the console the `adobeDataLayer` JavaScript object should be available. Enter the following command to get the Data Layer state of your current page:

    ```javascript
    window.adobeDataLayer.getState();
    ```

## Core Components Data Schemas {#data-schemas}

The following is a list of schemas that the Core Components use with the Data Layer.

### Component/Container Item Schema {#item}

The Component/Container Item schema is used in the following components:

* [Breadcrumb](/help/components/breadcrumb.md)
* [Button](/help/components/button.md)
* [Language Navigation](/help/components/language-navigation.md)
* [List](/help/components/list.md)
* [Navigation](/help/components/navigation.md)
* [Teaser](/help/components/teaser.md)
* [Text](/help/components/text.md)
* [Title](/help/components/title.md)

The Component/Container Item schema is defined as follows.

```javascript
id: {                   // component ID
    @type               // resource type
    repo:modifyDate     // last modified date
    dc:title            // title
    dc:description      // description
    xdm:text            // text
    xdm:linkURL         // link URL
    parentId            // parent component ID
}
```

The following [event](#events) is relevant to the Component/Container Item schema:

* `cmp:click`

### Page Schema {#page}

The Page schema is used by the following component:

* [Page](/help/components/page.md)

The Page schema is defined as follows.

```javascript
id: {
    @type
    repo:modifyDate
    dc:title

    dc:title
    dc:description
    xdm:text
    xdm:linkURL
    parentId
    shownItems          // array of the displayed item IDs
}
```

}
```

The following [event](#events) is relevant to the Image schema:

* `cmp:click`

### Asset Schema {#asset}

The Asset schema is used inside the [Image component.](/help/components/image.md)

The Asset schema is defined as follows.

```javascript
id: {
    repo:id             // asset UUID
    repo:path           // asset path
    @type               // asset resource type
    xdm:tags            // asset tags
    repo:modifyDate
}
```

The following [event](#events) is relevant to the Asset schema:

* `cmp:click`

### Content Fragment Schema {#content-fragment}

The Content Fragment schema is used by the [Content Fragment component.](/help/components/content-fragment-component.md)

The Content Fragment schema is defined as follows.

```javascript
id: {
    @type
    repo:modifyDate
    dc:title
    dc:description
    xdm:text
    xdm:linkURL

}
```

The schema used for the Content Fragment element is as follows.

```javascript
{
    xdm:title           // title
    xdm:text            // text
}
```

## Core Component Events {#events}

There are a number of events that Core Components trigger via the Data Layer. The best practice for interacting with the Data Layer is to [register an event listener](https://github.com/adobe/adobe-client-data-layer/wiki#addeventlistener) and *then* take an action based on the event type and/or component that triggered the event. This will avoid potential race conditions with asynchronous scripts.

Below are the out of the box events provided by AEM Core Components:

* **`cmp:click`** - Clicking a clickable element (an element that has a `data-cmp-clickable` attribute) causes the data layer to trigger a `cmp:click` event.
* **`cmp:show`** and **`cmp:hide`** - Manipulating the accordion (expand/collapse), the carousel (next/previous buttons), and the tabs (tab select) components causes the data layer to trigger `cmp:show` and a `cmp:hide` events respectively. A `cmp:show` event is also dispatched on page load and is expected to be the first event.
* **`cmp:loaded`** - As soon as the Data Layer is populated with the Core Components on the page, the Data Layer triggers a `cmp:loaded` event.

### Events Triggered by Component {#events-components}

The following tables list the standard Core Components that trigger events along with those events.

|Component|Event(s)|
|---|---|
|[Accordion](/help/components/accordion.md)|`cmp:show` and `cmp:hide`|
|[Button](/help/components/button.md)|`cmp:click`|
|[Breadcrumb](/help/components/breadcrumb.md)|`cmp:click`|
|[Carousel](/help/components/carousel.md)|`cmp:show` and `cmp:hide`|
|[Language Navigation](/help/components/language-navigation.md)|`cmp:click`|
|[Navigation](/help/components/navigation.md)|`cmp:click`|
|[Page](/help/components/page.md)|`cmp:show`|
|[Tabs](/help/components/tabs.md)|`cmp:show` and `cmp:hide`|
|[Teaser](/help/components/teaser.md)|`cmp:click`|

### Event Path Info {#event-path-info}

Each Data Layer event that is triggered by an AEM Core Component will include a payload with the following JSON object:

```json
eventInfo: {
    path: '<component-path>'
}
```

Where `<component-path>` is the JSON path to the component in the Data Layer that triggered the event.  The value, available via `event.eventInfo.path`,  is important as it can be used as a parameter to `adobeDataLayer.getState(<component-path>)` which retrieves the current state of the component that triggered the event, allowing custom code to access additional data and add it to the Data Layer.

For example:

```javascript

function logEventObject(event) {
    if(event.hasOwnProperty("eventInfo") && event.eventInfo.hasOwnProperty("path")) {
        var dataObject = window.adobeDataLayer.getState(event.eventInfo.path);
        console.debug("The component that triggered this event: ");
        console.log(dataObject);
    }
}

window.adobeDataLayer = window.adobeDataLayer || [];
window.adobeDataLayer.push(function (dl) {
     dl.addEventListener("cmp:show", logEventObject);
});
```
