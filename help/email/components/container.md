# Email Container Component {#email-container-component}

The Email Container Component allows for the creation of a container for multiple additional components in your email content.

## Usage {#usage}

The Email Container component allows for the creation of a container for multiple additional components in your email content and can be used to group other components and apply a common style or layout.

* Defaults for the Email Container Component when adding it to a page can be defined in the [design dialog.](#design-dialog)

Once an Email Container component is added to a page, a content author can drag-and-drop additional components into it.

### Default Components Tab {#default-components-tab}

The **Default Components** tab is used to define which component is added to the component when a particular asset type is dropped on the container, similar to [how default components are defined on the page template.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/features/templates.html)

### Container Settings Tab {#container-settings-tab}

The **Container Settings** tab defines if the author can define a background image or color.
